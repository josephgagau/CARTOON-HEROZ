		<h2> </h2>
		<p> West London born and bred, these days filmmaker and photographer Dexter Navy splits his time between the capital, LA and Paris.<br>The Partisan-repped directer has shot music videos for Rainy Milo, Jamie Isaac and perhaps most impressively, for “Pretty Flacko” rapper, producer, director and model A$AP Rocky’s track “L$D”, the video for which won Dexter a nomination for Best New Director at the UK Music Video Awards last year. <br>Somewhere in between flying back and forth across the Atlantic and hanging out with world-famous rappers, Dexter has found the time to hold his first solo photography exhibition 36 at east London’s Hoxton Gallery, shoot MIA, Travis Scott, Theophilus London, a lookbook for Billionaire Boys Club, direct spots for Red Bull Music Academy, Amuse, Nike and Havana and (of course) to feature in Dazed 100.  </p>
